## üîß Configuration Options

### Operating Hours Configuration
To modify court operating hours, update the `operatingHours` object in `js/app.js`:
```javascript
this.operatingHours = {
    start: '06:00',  // Change opening time
    end: '23:00'     // Change closing time
};
```

### Pricing Configuration
Court pricing is managed in the database `courts` table:
- **Indoor Courts**: Currently ‚Çπ10,000/hour (‚Çπ15,000 per 90-min slot)
- **Outdoor Courts**: Currently ‚Çπ7,000/hour

To update pricing:
1. Access the Admin Panel
2. Navigate to court management (future feature)
3. Or update directly in the database via API calls

### Court Configuration
Number of courts can be modified in the initial data setup:
- Current: 4 Indoor + 4 Outdoor courts

- Maintains audit trail with timestamps

#### Courts Table
- Contains court configuration
- Manages pricing and availability
- Supports maintenance scheduling

### Data Backup
- Data is automatically backed up in the cloud
- No manual backup required for basic deployment
- For enterprise deployments, consider additional backup strategies

### Data Migration
If migrating from existing booking systems:
1. Export existing data to CSV format
2. Map fields to the system's schema
3. Use the API to bulk import data
4. Verify data integrity after import
