## 🔧 Key Implementation Details

### Booking Logic Algorithm
```javascript
// Indoor Courts - Fixed 90-minute slots
if (court.court_type === 'Indoor') {
    duration = 90; // Fixed 90 minutes
    amount = court.hourly_rate * 1.5; // ₹15,000
}

// Outdoor Courts - Custom duration
else {
    const durationHours = parseFloat(userSelection);
    duration = durationHours * 60; // Convert to minutes
    amount = court.hourly_rate * durationHours; // ₹7,000/hour
}
```

### Time Slot Generation
```javascript
generateTimeSlots(court) {
    const slots = [];
    const slotDuration = court.court_type === 'Indoor' ? 90 : 60;
    
    for (let time = startTime; time < endTime; time += slotDuration) {
        const isBooked = this.isSlotBooked(court, timeStr, duration);
        slots.push({ startTime, endTime, duration, isBooked });
    }
    return slots;
}
```

### Revenue Calculation Engine
```javascript
// MTD Revenue Calculation
const mtdBookings = this.bookings.filter(booking => 
    booking.date >= startOfMonthStr && 
    booking.date <= todayStr && 
    booking.status !== 'Cancelled'
);

const totalRevenue = mtdBookings.reduce((sum, booking) => 
    sum + booking.amount_paid, 0
);
```

## 📊 Advanced Reporting Implementation

### Date Range Analysis
```javascript
generateDateRangeReport() {
    const filteredBookings = this.bookings.filter(booking => 
        booking.date >= startDate && booking.date <= endDate
    );
    
    const metrics = {
        totalRevenue: completedBookings.reduce((sum, b) => sum + b.amount_paid, 0),
        totalBookings: filteredBookings.length,
        cancellationRate: (cancelledBookings.length / totalBookings) * 100,
        indoorVsOutdoor: calculateBreakdown(completedBookings)
    };
}
```

### Future Bookings Engine
```javascript
showFutureBookings() {
    const futureBookings = this.bookings.filter(booking => 
        booking.date > today && booking.status !== 'Cancelled'
    ).sort((a, b) => new Date(a.date + ' ' + a.start_time) - new Date(b.date + ' ' + b.start_time));
}
```

            booking.customer_name, booking.amount_paid, booking.status
        ])
